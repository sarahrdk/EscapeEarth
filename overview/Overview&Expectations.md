# Project Overview

In the year 2020, our climate crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic have many feeling
 the need to escape - but to where? During the Escape Earth Experience, we will 
 be hunting for exoplanets orbiting stars observed by the Transiting Exoplanet 
 Survey Satellite (TESS). Since TESS is an all-sky survey, we will learn how to 
 manage big data sets while studying one of its observed sectors containing 
 ~20,000 nearby stars. Each star’s data is called a light curve, which is multiple 
 measurements of the star’s brightness over a period of time. For this project, 
 our main goals will be to create a GitHub hosted library of tools to analyze these 
 light curves and use data visualizations to support our characterization of the 
 new worlds we find. We will program in Python using Google Colaboratory and then 
 transition to the text editor Atom to build functions, attributes and document our 
 code. We will learn how to pull out periodic signals caused by an exoplanet 
 transiting its host star and calculate exoplanet properties such as mass and 
 radius. During the Escape Earth Experience we will learn what it takes to search 
 for Earth’s Plan(et) B.

# Internship Expectations

### General

1. Be present and active from 4:30pm-6:30pm on Tuesdays/Thursdays
2. We will use git push, pull and pull requests to keep our GitHub's up-to-date
3. Respect and support each other, everyone's voice is valuable 
4. Ask for help! (But also try to find solutions - google is your friend)
5. Keep video cameras ON, use virtual backgrounds if possible
6. An exit survey is required at the end of every session

### Attendance Specific

1. Anticipated absences/lateness/early leave: email bridgeupstem@amnh.org 
   and cc drowland@amnh.org and cc a guardian.
2. If you need to step away for 5 mins or less, put a message in the zoom chat
3. If you will be away longer than 5 mins, still put a message in the zoom chat
   and expect to do one of the make up methods listed below.
4. If you miss a session completely: depending on the material missed you should
   catch up via a make up method listed below.  
5. Successful completion of the program == ending with no more than 5 absences; 
   3 late/early leaves = 1 absence
   
Make up Methods
(how much material/work was missed will determine which method is appropriate)

1. stay during a 5 minute break (concept missed)
2. stay after a session  (complex concept and/or work missed)
3. email me to schedule a make up session (usually a full class missed)


** Also note that you can use these methods if you want additional help too, not just as make up
