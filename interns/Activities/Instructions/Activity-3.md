# Activity - 3



# Instructions:
We're going to search the LightKurve library for functions that will 
help us clean our raw light curves. We will need to understand the 
required input and output data in order to use the functions. We will 
then create a tutorial notebook to show how to implement the function
using a subsample of 5 of our raw light curves previously downloaded.   


## Teams
#### Remove Nans --- Elise, Maria
#### Remove Outliers --- Anna-Claire, Sarah
#### Remove Rotational Modulations via Flattening --- Olivia, Eliza


## Info to collect for tutorial
1. Which class method (function) to use
2. What are the required *args (input parameters to use the function)
3. How to apply the cleaning method on the data
4. (Bonus) How to save the newly cleaned data



##### Tips: For number 1 remember to check that the input data is of the correct class type to use the class method you have chosen. You may have to change the data into a different class type to apply a method. See tutorial example [here](https://github.com/deerow22/EscapeEarth/blob/main/interns/Activities/Data/Activity_3.ipynb)
